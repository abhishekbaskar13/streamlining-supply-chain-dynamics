# About the project

This project analyzes supply chain of an Indiana-based seed manufacturer and highlights areas for optimization - focusing on excessive shipments, warehouse mapping, and inventory transfers. The aim of this project is help cut costs in the various stages of the supply chain to increase the profitability of the company. We performed three analyses and created deliverables for them:

1. Network Optimization - we modelled their supply chain operations using a linear programming model to help understand which warehouses can serve customers best and with least cost for a given product, and to model the inter-warehouse transfers required to meet the customer demand. We delivered a self-serve Python notebook (Pandas, NumPy and PuLP)
2. Intercompany transfers - we studied the patterns of inter-warehouse transfers over the years and developed an exponential weighted moving average formulma to estimate the safety stock levels for each product and warehouse.
3. Excessive shipments analysis - we studied the correlation between excessive shipments (when one order is broken into multiple shipments due to planning inefficiencies) and customer retention. We delivered a Tableau dashboard for points 2 and 3.

More details about the implementation and the impact can be found in the poster.

As this was a project done for a corporate partner, I cannot share the code here but if you want any more information, please reach out to me on abhishekbaskar13@gmail.com or baskar2@purdue.edu or on LinkedIn.
